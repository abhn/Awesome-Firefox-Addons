# Awesome Firefox Add-ons
Curated list of my favourite Firefox Add-ons / Extensions

## Must haves
- [Ublock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/): An excellent general purpose content blocker, ad blocker. I'm sometimes surprised when I'm using other people's browsers to see how different my version of the web has become thanks to this one extension.

## Good to have
- [Bitwarden Password Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/): Open source and free password manager. For an optional <1$ per month you can enable some additional features. If you don't already have a password manager, Bitwarden might be a good place to start.
- [SponsorBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/): Automatically skips sponsored sections of Youtube videos.
- [Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/): Allows separation of browsing context without having to create separate profiles or using different browsers. Now I can have two Google accounts logged into two containers in tabs sitting next to each other.
- [Feedbro](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feedbroreader/): If you're still using RSS
- [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/): Useful for quick dirty scripting on web pages. Head over to https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts to give the world of userscripts a shot.
- [Keepa](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepa/): Shows the price history of a product on Amazon.
- [Tree Style Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/): Get tabs as a sidebar instead of up top.
- [2FAS](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2fas-two-factor-authentication/): Automatically copy and paste 2FA code from iOS into Firefox

## Cater to my specific use case
- [Obsidian Bookmarks](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/obsidian-bookmarks/): Send current tab's URL and Title as a markdown link to your Obsidian Vault
